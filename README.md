This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## Run the app

Run the app using `npm start`

The app should be a group of expansion panels each displaying the data for a city and showing the next 5 forecasts with 3 hour gaps between them. (API limitation)
